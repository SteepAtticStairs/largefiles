There is a specific way how files are named, which is pertinent to what game / video they are. This aims to be a complete, comprehensive guide.</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span>Each file name generally has a </span><span class="c17">number</span><span>&nbsp;to the left of it, the </span><span class="c17">name</span><span>&nbsp;of the video (this can be the team that Kentucky is playing, the description of the video, things like that), the </span><span class="c17">date</span><span>&nbsp;that the video was aired, and a </span><span class="c17">filename extension</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these parts are not on all of the files, because not all of these descriptors are necessary for all videos. I will walk through each possible file name structure, give examples, and explain how they are named.</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c12 c11">1. Full Game Replays</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">These videos are full game replays from the regular season. This is an example of how these files are named:</span></p><p class="c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">21</span><span class="c7">Kansas</span><span class="c16 c11">_</span><span class="c0">1.29.2022</span><span class="c11">.mp4</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c5 c6 c8">I have divided this into several segments, so I can explain the individual parts easier.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c6">First, the </span><span class="c3">21 </span><span class="c6">part is the </span><span class="c1">game number</span><span class="c6">. This number just means what game of the season Kentucky played this team. Since the file above was named </span><span class="c1">21</span><span class="c5 c6 c8">Kansas, that means that the game was played as the 21st game of the season.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c6">Second, the </span><span class="c7">Kansas </span><span class="c6">part is a </span><span class="c1">description</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;of the video. The description is almost always the team that Kentucky plays, except for preseason and extra videos. There are some instances, like in the SEC Tournament or the NCAA Tournament, that the description adds additional information about the game played. For example, you might have a game like </span><span class="c1">39</span><span class="c7">Louisville_NCAATournamentFinalFour</span><span class="c1">_3.31.2012</span><span class="c6">, where the description is highlighted in blue. The </span><span class="c1">NCAATournamentFinalFour</span><span class="c5 c6 c8">&nbsp;is just to tell you that the game was the Final Four in the NCAA Tournament.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c6">Third, and very briefly, the </span><span class="c16 c11">_ </span><span class="c6">part is just an </span><span class="c1">underscore</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">separator</span><span class="c5 c6 c8">&nbsp;for different parts of the file name, so they don&rsquo;t get jumbled together.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c6">Fourth, the </span><span class="c0">1.29.2022 </span><span class="c6">part is the </span><span class="c1">date</span><span class="c6">. This is very simple, it is just when the game was played, or when the video was aired. It is organized in </span><span class="c1">month.day.year</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;format, so </span><span class="c1">1.29.2022</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;would be </span><span class="c1">January 29, 2022</span><span class="c5 c6 c8">.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c6">Finally, the </span><span class="c1">.mp4</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;is just the </span><span class="c1">filename extension</span><span class="c5 c6 c8">. You might have more of these than just .mp4, but this is also pretty self-explanatory.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c5 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c5 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">2. Preseason / Exhibition Games</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">These videos are events that happen before the regular season, such as Big Blue Madness, the Blue-White Game, and exhibition games. For example, the Big Blue Madness file for 2021-22 would be named as such:</span></p><p class="c4"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">-00</span><span class="c7">BigBlueMadness</span><span class="c16 c11">_</span><span class="c0">10.14.2011</span><span class="c11">.mp4</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5 c6 c8">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the same naming system as the full game replays, but the thing different is the game number. Since preseason videos are not games of the season, they are marked as 00. The dash at the start is to ensure that they are listed first when putting the files for a season in alphabetical order.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For exhibition games, they are very similar to preseason games, but the game number is changed a little bit. For example:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">-02</span><span class="c7">Asbury</span><span class="c11 c16">_</span><span class="c0">11.6.2016</span><span class="c5 c11 c12">.mp4</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c11">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>This video is the second exhibition game of the season, played against Asbury, on November 6, 2016. The game number is 02 now, which is different from what we have seen before. The second number, a </span><span class="c11">2</span><span>, is to tell you that it is the second exhibition game of the season. The first number, a </span><span class="c11">0</span><span>, is to tell you that it is not a regular season game, but an exhibition game. Again, </span><span class="c6">the dash at the start is to ensure that these files are listed first when putting the files for a season in alphabetical order.</span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c5 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c15"><span class="c5 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">3. Extra Videos</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c6">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These videos can range anywhere from game highlights to trophy presentations. They are videos that are relevant to that basketball season, but they are not generally straight game replays. They are listed at the end of the file list for a basketball season. For example, the video for the pregame of the 2012 Championship is named:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">z_</span><span class="c5 c7">NationalChampionshipFULLPregame</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c5 c6 c8">This is a little different from other file names, but it follows the same rules. </span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c6">First, there is no date on the game, because it can either be figured out easily by the user, or there is no date to put on the video. For example</span><span class="c6">. </span><span class="c3">z_</span><span class="c7">2011-12KentuckyTournamentHighlights</span><span class="c5 c6 c8">&nbsp;could not have a date, because highlights are compilations which don&rsquo;t air on a certain day.</span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c6">Second, the game number has been replaced by a </span><span class="c3">z_</span><span class="c6">. The </span><span class="c1">z underscore</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;is for two reasons. First, there is no game number for these videos, because they are not full game replays. The reason they are a </span><span class="c1">z</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;is to ensure that they are listed last when putting the files for a season in alphabetical order. The underscore is so that the </span><span class="c1">z</span><span class="c5 c6 c8">&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t get confused and added to the description part of the video&rsquo;s file name.</span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c5 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c9"><span class="c5 c6 c8"></span></p><p class="c4 c10"><span class="c6">Hopefully this guide has helped you out. If you are still confused, looking at the many seasons posted on my website will hopefully give you plenty of examples of how the file naming system is used. There are descriptions of their own on some of the season&rsquo;s webpages, so those might help you out as well. The </span><span class="c1">2011-12</span><span class="c5 c6 c8">&nbsp;page is very well documented with very many sections, so I might point you to that page first.</span></p></body></html>
